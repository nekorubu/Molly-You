# Molly-You

This is a small fork of Signal for me to try and implement Material You colors in Molly (see [this issue](https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/issues/300)).

## For the Molly Devs (and anyone interested in helping)
This fork implements them in a way that replaces most, if not all the colors with Material You ones, meaning that you cannot choose between the two. As of now, I do not know how to allow the user to choose between the two, so unless someone helps out in that area, it will likely be a while before that ability is implemented.
